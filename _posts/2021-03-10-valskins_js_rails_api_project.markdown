## What I Learned...

**1) The JS Rabbit Hole Goes Deep:** Maybe not everybody agrees with this sentiment - but I can confidently say that even after this project its evident I need to spend way more time learning it. Maybe the React segment will fill in some of the gaps but there's still a feeling of being a baby deer learning to walk.

**2) JS Classes:** After starting this course with Ruby (and later Rails) there was a bit of confusion when it came to classes. ES6 introduced JS classes and they aren't exactly the Objected Oriented ones I came to know. I had to read into the differences to understand the purpose of JS classes and how they're considered 'special functions' more than anything else. The similarity being they allow you to encapsulate your logic into a more organized manner.

## The Application...

I've been playing a lot of Valorant so I was trying to think of a good way to base this project around it. So I decided to make a library of sorts to display the weapon skins that are currently in the game (just think of fancy/cool looking guns). Since these are paid products I also included how much each skin costs.

This was a very simple single page application that has 1 association (Collections have many Skins).

## Final Thoughts...

1 more project down & 1 to go. The finish line is finally in sight and it's on me to finish this course out with pace and confidence.
