## What I Learned...

**1) The Grind:** Honestly this is a bit of a cliche but this course really taught me how to grind when I needed to. While I've definitely put in hard work in other aspects of my life - this just felt different. It not only required a great deal of time commitment but also a ton of mental energy. I can confidently say nothing has challenged me more mentally than this course & ALL of the projects.
**2) The Beauty of React:** Completing my previous project in 'Vanilla' JS made it super obvious to me how convenient React is as a library. The Virtual DOM & reusable components make the entire development process a bit easier. However - at the end of the day it's all JS so there aren't crazy differences where using React becomes a no brainer for any project regardless of the scale.
**3) Redux Isn't Rocket Science:** While reading the lessons in the course there were definitely times where I had no idea what the hell I was reading. Some of the lessons were a bit long winded & complex (at least to me) so getting through it was a bit brutal. But once I got to implementing it into my project it became a lot more simple. In simple terms:

*- Redux is a state management tool*
*- There's a 'Store' where you STORE all your data
- Actions are basically just descriptions of what you want to do to the state
- Reducers are functions that take in the STATE & the ACTION and change the state*

When you understand exactly what state is & you think about what Store, Action, and Reducers are in simpler terms - it becomes much easier to implement.

## The Application...

I wanted to finish off this course with something I'm passionate about & that's sports. With the NBA heading into the final stretch of the regular season I thought this would be a great time to do an ESPN type application that gets real time scores/data through an API. 

**'NBA Scores'** allows you to easily see past and present scores as well as allows you to view a league schedule & individual team results/schedule.

**Fun Fact:** I finished this project exactly 5 years from Kobe's last game in the NBA. RIP Mamba. (Tribute in the logo)

## Final Thoughts...

I'd be lying if I said there weren't times during the course where I just wanted to give up. The idea of spending countless hours trying to solve what many devs would consider a "simple problem" was frustrating. But you have to keep everything in perspective. This is a journey meant to challenge your way of thinking about logic and problem solving. Going through this process has improved me in more ways than just writing lines of code - and for that I am grateful to Flatiron.

Almost time to leave the nest.
