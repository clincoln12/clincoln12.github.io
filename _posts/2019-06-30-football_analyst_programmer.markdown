Code has been something that has interested me for quite some time now. This mainly stems from my friends who were Computer Science majors and always talked about how much they enjoy what they do.

Having various daily tasks/problem solving, building cool new things and having a skill that can be used in any part of the world is something that is very appealing to me. As a football analyst I get to watch a lot of football which is definitely a sick gig - but it comes with more pains than many would know on the outside looking in. Lots of numbers, tedious charting, and struggles for advancement make it something hard to stay invested in for a long time. Don't get me wrong - football is and will likely always be my #1 passion, but I see programming as a skill with more practical use. One day I hope to combine my knowledge of both to build something special.

I look forward to completeing the Flatiron course and continuing to expand on what I learn for years to come!
